1. Move/Change VPC of "DXPlatformPortal-Staging" and all resources from "default vpc" to "dxpf-loganalysis-pro"

2. End point creation for "dxpf-loganalysis-pro" vpc and take care of SG to add inbound rule for accessing the endpoint via the SG or whatever




Hi Team,
 
As per the Confirmation from Nakajima-San, we will be planning to perform OS level remediation activity (DXPF-1585) for the Dx-Portal staging 
environment on 30-07-2024(Tuesday) starting from 11:30 AM IST.
We will inform you once it's completed on our side, so you can test and confirm the functionality.
